ERISXdl - Nirmal Lab Documentation
=============================================

This is documentation for getting started with computing at Mass General Brigham. It is based on the
`Texas Advanced Computing Center <https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/lonestar6/>`_ 
computing documentation. It is part self-written, part collection of documents from the associated `knowledge base <https://rc.partners.org/kb>`_. 

.. note::

   This guide is written assuming you are familiar with using a UNIX based command line system. It tries to not assume that
   you understand the way that ERISXdl is structured, the specific software stack it uses, or that you have any background
   in the niche environment of high-performance computing. 

These documents:

- Focus on ERISXdl, the GPU computing cluster.
- Aim to be more up to date. They will only use :code:`SLURM`, etc.
- Guide users succesively, starting with information about the available partitions, modules, and development.
- Are displayed on one page such that a user can navigate forwards and backwards through without refreshing a new page.
