# Preliminary Steps for Nirmal Lab Members

1. First, request an account using this link: [https://rc.partners.org/scic-cluster-account-request](https://rc.partners.org/scic-cluster-account-request)
2. *Requesting an account does not give you access to ERISXdl*. To remedy this, you need to ask Jay Omobono (IT support) at [jomobono@bwh.harvard.edu](jomobono@bwh.harvard.edu) and CC Dr. Nirmal to request access for this machine. 
3. Verify your access to the group by calling `groups` from the command line.
